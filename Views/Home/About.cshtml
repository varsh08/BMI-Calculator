    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. </li>
            <li>  It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height.</li>
            <li>Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between.</li>
        </ul>
